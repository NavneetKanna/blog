This blog is intended to understand:
1. c fundamentals 
2. How a program is structed in memeory and  executed
3. some bits of os (I will have another blog post dedicated to only os)

This will be a Q and A type of blog, where all the questions are what I have asked myself while doing a c project and the answer from research.

** What is strtok and strtok_r ? **
