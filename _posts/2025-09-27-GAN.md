GANs are generative models: they create new data instances that resemble the training data. There are 2 models involved: Generators and Discriminators.

As the name suggests, Generators generates fake data, while Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

Let's look at some code to understand it better.

First lets start with generator. It takes in random noise and generates and outputs a sample.

```python

```
